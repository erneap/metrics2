  <h1>Editing the Basic Mission Information</h1>
  <img src="../images/empty_msn.png">
  <p>
   You'll notice in the empty mission display, the top three input fields are 
   Mission Date, Mission Platform and Sortie ID.  These three data elements 
   are how the missions are separated and based on the platform, changes are 
   made.
  </p> 
  <p><span class="importantNote">NOTE:</span> Most fields on the display cause
    changes to be recorded.  There is <span class="importantNote">NO</span> Save
    button and all modifications are saved as you left the edit box or field.
  </p>
  <p>Create or Edit a mission:
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>Click on the calendar icon in the Mission Date editor.  This will bring
        up a calendar for you to pick the date for the mission.
      </li>
      <li>Click in the Platform Editor and a list of available platforms or 
        aircraft types will display.  Select the correct platform for this 
        mission.  If the mission is already entered for the date and platform, 
        a sortie identifier will display.
      </li>
      <li>If necessary, type in the sortie for this mission in the space provided.  If the 
        mission is already in database, this will fill in the rest of the form 
        with the available data.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    Your display will be similar to those shown above, the data and edit field 
    will be different.  The sensor edit tabs may be like the U2 mission display,
    where you have multiple selections or only one for the mission, even none
    at all.  These are determined by your workcenter/permission combination.
  </p>
  <p>Now lets go through each field:</p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>Mission Exploitation:  (Select One) This is the value for our site's involvement 
      in exploiting the imagery or other information.  Possible values include:
      Primary - done on site, Shadow - receive only for monitoring, Federated - 
      controlled by another site, but helping with the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tail Number - (U2 Missions only) This is holds the letter designator for 
      the mission aircraft's tail number.
    </li>
    <li>
      Communications - (Select One) This is the way we, or the other site, are 
      reveiving the information from the the mission sensors.  LOS - Line-of-Sight,
      Ext-LOS - Line-of-Sight, but sent to other, Non-LOS - any other method.
    </li>
    <li>
      Primary DCGS - (Select One) This is the site who has control of the 
      mission.  There is a choice for all available sites.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mission Overlap:  (Optional) This value in hours:minutes is the amount
      of time this mission overlaps another or in the area at the same time.  
      4:30 is stating that this mission overlaps another mission for 4 hours and 
      30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Overall Mission Comments: (Optional) This field is used to record any 
      comments that affect the mission as a whole.  There are separate comment
      fields for each sensor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lastly there are three checkboxes for mission cancellation (before takeoff),
      abort (after takeoff, but before on-station), and indefinte delay.  Check 
      these boxes if needed.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <span class="importantNote">Clear a Mission: </span> If you need to clear 
    the displayed mission, just click on the Clear Icon 
    (<img src="../images/clear_icon.png" class="icon">) in the upper-right 
    portion of the mission view.  This will not delete a mission already created 
    just empty the input fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="importantNote">Delete a Mission: </span> If you need to delete 
    the current displayed mission from the database, click on the Delete Icon 
    (<img src="../images/delete_icon.png" class="icon">) in the upper-right portion of the
